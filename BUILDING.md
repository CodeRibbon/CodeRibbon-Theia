Build process is not finalized yet, currently only Appimage is built for linux systems.

It is recommended to build from source for now, see `DEVELOPING.md` first for basic environment setup.

The sources for the two kinds of builds are `browser-app` and `electron-app`, with Electron builds being packaged by electron-builder.
