# CodeRibbon-Theia

A Theia extension that implements the CodeRibbon workspace.

Since the most prominent response to the CodeRibbon Atom implementation was "When can I get this for VSCode?" here is the answer.

This Theia extension brings the CodeRibbon workspace to an editor compatible with VSCode plugins. While this extension can be used in other Theia-based editors, the goal here is to make an editor available and useful for the general public.

If you don't know what CodeRibbon is, you can [read the paper](https://austinhenley.com/pubs/Klein2021ICSME_CodeRibbon.pdf) or check out the [Atom implementation](https://github.com/CodeRibbon/CodeRibbon).

# Status

Very early development: while the system works and you can try it out by building the project, most features are not yet implemented.
